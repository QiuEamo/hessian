Fast Python Hessian Module
==========================

I don't know what this image says about a Hessian api, but at any rate, if you
need to interface with a Hessian api (They) and the regular Python version is
just not performing fast enough, then this module is what you're looking for.
It simply wraps the existing C++ version of the Hessian protocol as a Python
module for your computing pleasure. Now you can get all the speed of the
low-level compiled version from within your Python code without feeling like
the api looks/feels like the picture above.
